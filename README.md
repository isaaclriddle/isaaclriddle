#Tidy Data - Hadley Wickham#
> Journal of Statistical Software 59, no. 10 (2014)

* "...data tidying: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis." (1)
	* "Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning)." (2)
	*  "In tidy data:
		1. Each variable forms a column.
		2. Each observation forms a row.
		3. Each type of observational unit forms a table." (4)
* "A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative)." (3)
	* "Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units.An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes." (3)
* "A general rule of thumb is that it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables (e.g., z is a linear combination of x and y, density is the ratio of weight to volume) than between rows, and it is easier to make comparisons between groups of observations (e.g., average of group a vs. average of group b) than between groups of columns." (4)
